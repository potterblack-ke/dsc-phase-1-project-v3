# Avionics Ltd - Flight Risk Analysis

**Author**: [Tim Musungu]

## Understanding the Business Problem and Data Question
- Our company is looking to expand into new industries in order to diversify its portfolio, specifically in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.
- As the resident Data Scientist, we are charged with identifying the aircraft that are the 'lowest risk' in order to inform business decisions in starting this new endeavour.
- Afterwards, we are to translate our findings into actionable insights for the head of the new aviation division to use.

## Understanding the Data
- We have been provided with a dataset that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
- In addition to civil aviation accidents, the dataset covers selected incidents in the United States and in international waters.


## Methods

We applied exploratory data analysis techniques including descriptive analysis in which we grouped, sorted and filtered out the necessary subset of our data. We also computed summary statistics as part of our methodology.

## Results
We identified the top 5 safest aircraft by Category and Make and made a specific recommendations as to which aircraft was the best acquisition ('Boeing Airplanes').

### Conclusions & Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights for the Avionics Division include:

- **Trend analysis**: We can expand our analysis by examining *risk trends over time* for each aircraft make and category. This can help us answer the question of whether some aircraft are becoming safer due to improvements in safety standards
- **Geospatial Analysis**: We can also start mapping incident locations to identify any 'hotspots' that may pose higher risks for specific aircraft categories and models. This would inform the flight path planning for the Aviation Division and might reveal region-specific risk factors or operational challenges
